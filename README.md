# AWA5.RS

An [AWA5.0](https://github.com/TempTempai/AWA5.0) CLI tool written in Rust (btw)

Runs as an AWA5.0 interpreter for Awatisms with file extension `.awasm` and Awatalk with file extension `.awa`

Can also run as an assembler for Awatisms and Awatalk to object files, and assembled object files with extension `.o` can be run by the interpreter

## Installation

To install or build from source, you will need to have `rust` or `rustup` installed

```bash
# using Arch Linux's package manager
$ sudo pacman -S rust # or rustup
```

If you installed `rustup`, you need to install a toolchain

```bash
$ rustup toolchain install latest
```

$ ./target/debug/awa5_rs # you can also build and run with `cargo run`, and you can pass flags with `cargo run -- --help` for example
```

### Web builds
